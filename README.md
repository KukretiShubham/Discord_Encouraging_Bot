# Discord_Encouraging_Bot
A discord bot which detects messages compare from dictionary and send encouraging messages from list and also sends inspiring quotes using an third party api.

This bot service can be deployed on any cloud service 

I deployed it on free cloud service named repl.it

## about .env file
--> Since the code on repl.it is public and anyone can see the code.
    so .env gives the cover to your token variable(the unique token code your bot) is the only file not visible 

## To keep bot alive and up
---> to keep it alive we allowed constant ping at freqency of 5 mint from an third party pinging service
    this keeps our bot online in discord
